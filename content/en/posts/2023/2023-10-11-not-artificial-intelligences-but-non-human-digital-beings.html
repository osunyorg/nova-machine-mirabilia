        <p>Two paragraphs that caught my attention in James Bridle’s <a href="https://jamesbridle.com/books/ways-of-being">recent book</a> about the diversity of more-than-human intelligence. While the book approaches this topic in a different way that my own approach here, there are definitely interesting insights in James’ text; for instance here, or whenever he discusses non-human agency as well as relations entities such as funghi, animals, plants or AI form with one another.</p>
