        <p>Random discovery this morning while looking at various academic publications this article called <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ae/article/65/2/97/5512520?login=true">Entomoludology: Arthropods in Video Games</a> by Matan Shelomi, published in <em>American Entomologist</em>, a journal that is not really focused on digital cultures and machine mirabilia.</p><p>    </p><p>As its author mentioned in the introduction, this piece is “a cultural entomological review of insects in video games”, relying on an inspiring method:</p><p>    </p><p>“For this review, I compared all recorded video games from the time of their invention in the 1950s (two decades before 1974’s <em>Pong</em>) until 2018, identifying any with potential entomological references. I mined the video game listings on Wikipedia.org and the comprehensive database of nearly 100,000 games on MobyGames.com for any game with an entomological name or details suggesting entomological content. I checked all games to verify that they actually involved insects; games with “bug” in the title surprisingly often referred to the Volkswagen Beetle. When possible, I scanned online gameplay videos, transcripts, and screenshots for entomologically relevant content. I also found appropriate video games using the entomology-related tropes at tvtropes.org, a wiki-type website that compiles media tropes and attempts to list all examples of each. In this way, I could find games with entomological content even if their content was otherwise inaccessible. Mobile games (games for smartphones and tablets only) and browser games (Internet-only games) were excluded from this review, because their production is unregulated and they are far too numerous to analyze.”</p><p>     </p><p>This “entomoludology” led the author to an insightful discussions on various topics: arthropods’ roles in the games as antagonists, allies or player-protagonists, the importance of insect items and building collections… and perhaps more interstingly, “eusocial insect behaviors” that overlap with science-fiction elements.</p><p>    </p><p><strong>Why do I blog this?</strong> NPCs and avatars certainly belongs to the machine mirabilia I’m interested in. Besides the methodology presented in this paper, I find it interesting to discover how a certain perspective, the one of an entomology researcher, consider certain dimensions of digital creatures. The paper also reminds me of Alenda Chang’s book <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/playing-nature">Playing Nature: Ecology in video-games</a>.</p>
