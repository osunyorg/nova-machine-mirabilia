        <p>This is the cover of the latest issue of Newsweek, found at the local shopping mall here in Geneva. With a Cthulhu-esque creature (probably generated by an AI system) and the name of our good friend of the Near Future Laboratory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a> right above a scary “IT’S HERE” title. This cover corresponds to the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2023/07/21/ai-scariest-beast-ever-created-says-sci-fi-writer-bruce-sterling-1809439.html">following online piece</a> about many things we’re dealing with here (not just HP Lovecraft imagery!). </p><p>    </p><p>In his article, Bruce deals with teratology, i.e. the science/discourse about monster (the term was borrowed from “<em>tératologie</em>” (French), which in turn was formed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language">Greek</a> τέρας <em>teras</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_stem">word stem</a> τέρατ- <em>terat-</em>), meaning “sign sent by the gods, portent, marvel, monster”, and <em>-ologie</em> (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-ology">-ology</a></em>), used to designate a discourse, science, or theory of some topic). His point is that “new AI” (i.e. “Large Language Models” and text/image generators) has “AI folklore. Authentic little myths. Legendry”, namely a “weird” symbolism people need “so they can learn how to feel about life”. Bruce discusses such symbolism with various examples of AI idioms, which have beast-like connotations: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk">Roko’s basilisk</a>, the <a href="https://machinemirabilia.wordpress.com/2023/07/06/lovecraftian-ai-part-deux-the-shoggoth-metaphor/">“Masked Shoggoth”</a> cartoon I mentioned this week, the mythical, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">“Paperclip Maximizer”</a>. As Bruce says, they are “all the poetic children of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, the original big tech monster” with “more staying power than the business op-eds, technical white-papers or executive briefings. Folk tales catch on because they mean something.”</p><p>    </p><p>To him, the current “entities” of AI are not only “stochastic parrots”, they are also mythical beasts that gives him a sense of an “high-tech Mardi Gras”, not the first one: “The street will find its own uses for these monsters.” as Bruce says, paraphrasing William Gibson’s famous quote about how laymen repurpose technologies for their own need/context. And like all Mardi Gras, there’ll be a sense of disillusionment, followed once again by a new kind of AI Spring, with perhaps new creatures.</p>
